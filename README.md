# javascript-challenge

This assignment uses JavaScript and DOM manipulation to allow for loading of a UFO sighting dataset into a table on a web page and then allowing users to filter the table data based on their inputs.


1.Only JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js are used.

2.UFO-level-1 folder provides all necessary files for the required automatic table and date search website.

3.UFO-level-2 folder provides all necessary files for the optional multiple search categories website.

4.The app.js file in the static folder provides most of the script to achieve the rendering of the table and search and rerendering of the table. "Event listeners" are used to trigger the filtering from user inputs. Users can use the "Filter Table/Enter" button or just hit "enter" on their keyboard.
